    "*This is only tangentially connected, but by coincidence I am currently reading a short story entitled \"Division by Zero\" by the American sci-fi author Ted Chiang which incorporates the unique properties of zero as a central element of the plot. The first paragraph of the story includes this observation on the properties of zero: \"Dividing a number by zero doesn't produce an infinitely large number as an answer... however, multiplying infinity by zero produces only zero, not any other number. There is nothing which can be multiplied by zero to produce a non-zero result; therefore, the result of a divsion by zero is literally \"undefined\".\"*"
