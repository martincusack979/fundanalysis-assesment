## Assessment: Fundamentals of Data Analysis

by Martin Cusack (I.D: G00239124)

### Introduction

This repository contains all work completed during the course of the Fundamentals of Data Analysis module.
The repository contains Jupyter Notebooks files, a gitignore file and a ReadMe file.

### Set Up

All exercises were completed in Jupyter notebooks.  

### Topic 1 : Information 

Exercise 1 - "Adapt the code above to generate a 1000 character long string with weights based on the previous two characters." 
This exercise is based on the analysis of a text file containing a paragraph from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.  The exercises in this section explore how placing weighted constraints on strings of randomly generated letters produce different, "less surprising" results.

Exercise 2 - Log of zero: "Explain why the log of zero is undefined."
