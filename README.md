# Assessment: Fundamentals of Data Analysis

by Martin Cusack (I.D: G00239124)

### Introduction

This repository contains all work completed during the course of the Fundamentals of Data Analysis module.
The repository contains Jupyter Notebooks files, a gitignore file and a ReadMe file.

### Set Up

All exercises were completed in Jupyter notebooks.  

### Topic 1 : Information 

The Information section of the module focused on some exploratory analysis of a text file containing a paragraph from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and outlined 
how placing increasing amounts of constraints on strings of randomly generated letters produce different, "less surprising" results.

Exercise 1 - "Adapt the code above to generate a 1000 character long string with weights based on the previous two characters." 
My work on Exercise 1 is saved in the Jupyter notebook entitled  01a-information-exercises.

Exercise 2 - Log of zero: "Explain why the log of zero is undefined." 
My work on Exercise 2 is saved in the Jupyter notebook entitled  01b-information-exercises.

### Topic 2 : Randomness

The Randomness section of the module explored the concept of randomly generated information through the framework of a coin toss (or series of coin tosses).
All three exercises for the Randomness section of the module are contained in the same Jupyter Notebook: 02-randomness-exercises.

Exercise 1 - "Do the results of the following calculations, related to the aforementioned coin-toss combinations, always come out as a positive whole number? What is
the formula in general? Does it always come out as a positive whole number?"

Exercise 2 - "Note that there are the same number of ways to get 4 tails as there to get 4 heads. Explain why this is."

Exercise 3 - Plot bar charts or histograms of any three different distributions listed at the following

### Topic 3 : Bias

This section of the module focused on two different forms of bias: Cognitive and Statistical.
My exercises for the Bias section of the module are contained in the same Jupyter Notebook: 03-bias-exercises.

Exercise 1 : "Give three real-world examples of cognitive bias"
